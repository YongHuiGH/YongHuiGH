- Summary and reflection~
  
To summarize all, this course is fun and interesting as there are a lot of things to be learnt. From the Information and technology course, I am able to learn things that related to IT and of course not related to IT. For example, learning the IT currently used, understanding the jobs available after finishing studies, working hand in hand with course mates and a lot. In my opinion, studying is important but we must gain experience and knowledges that can't be obtained from the reading materials, because those experiences and knowledges are useful for us in the future and could bring benefits for us.

TQ ~
